  <hr class="border-gray-700 mb-6" />

  <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify mb-6">
    Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a data mining technique used to identify patterns and relationships between different items in large datasets. It is commonly applied in market basket analysis, where businesses analyze customer purchase behavior to discover which products are frequently bought together. ARM helps uncover hidden correlations that can be used for recommendation systems, cross-selling strategies, and decision-making.

  <h3 class="text-white text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">What are Association Rules?</h3>

  <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify mb-4">
    An association rule is an implication of the form <span class="text-blue-400 font-medium">X ‚Üí Y</span>, meaning "if X occurs, then Y is likely to occur."
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
    For example, in retail analysis, a rule like:
    <br />
    <span class="bg-gray-800 px-2 py-1 inline-block mt-5 text-blue-400 font-mono text-sm rounded">{Bread, Butter} ‚Üí {Milk}</span>
    <br />
    <br/>
    suggests that customers who buy bread and butter are likely to buy milk as well.

  <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify mb-6">
    Apriori is one of the most popular algorithms for Association Rule Mining (ARM). It works by iteratively finding frequent itemsets and generating rules from them.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-white text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Steps of the Apriori Algorithm</h3>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify space-y-4 mb-6">
    <li>
      <span class="text-blue-400 font-medium">Calculate Support for Individual Items:</span> Identify items that meet the minimum support threshold.

    <li>
      <span class="text-blue-400 font-medium">Generate Frequent Itemsets:</span> Combine individual items to form pairs (2-itemsets), then triplets (3-itemsets), and so on.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="text-blue-400 font-medium">Prune Infrequent Itemsets:</span> Remove itemsets that do not meet the minimum support requirement.

    <li>
      <span class="text-blue-400 font-medium">Generate Association Rules:</span> Compute confidence and lift for the frequent itemsets. Keep rules that satisfy the minimum confidence threshold.

    The Apriori algorithm is efficient because it uses the <span class="text-blue-400 font-medium">"Apriori Principle"</span>, which states:
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg italic leading-relaxed text-justify my-4">
    If an itemset is infrequent, all its supersets must also be infrequent.

    Clustering groups similar items together, as shown by bread and butter in the same circle. In contrast, ARM identifies relationships between items, represented by the arrow from bread to butter, implying a purchasing pattern. While clustering finds inherent groups, ARM focuses on if-then associations, making both techniques valuable for different types of data analysis.

    The dataset was carefully preprocessed to ensure it met the requirements for Association Rule Mining (ARM). First, numerical attributes that were not relevant for identifying associations were removed. Categorical variables were then transformed into a transactional format using one-hot encoding, where each row represents a unique transaction containing different categorical attributes. This step ensures that the dataset is structured for frequent pattern mining. Finally, the cleaned data was formatted into a CSV file without headers, making it compatible with ARM techniques like the Apriori algorithm for uncovering meaningful patterns and associations.

    Association Rule Mining (ARM) is used in this project to uncover hidden relationships between different features in the dataset. It helps identify patterns, such as which factors are strongly linked to a successful marketing campaign. This is useful for decision-making, such as improving customer targeting strategies.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-white text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Key Measures in ARM</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify mb-4">
    In the context of this project, ARM uses the following metrics to assess the strength of discovered patterns:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify space-y-4 mb-6">
    <li>
      <span class="text-blue-400 font-medium">Support:</span> The proportion of records in which a particular feature combination appears.
      <br />
      <span class="italic">Example:</span> If 30% of customers had both "previous contact" and "high balance," the support is 0.30.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="text-blue-400 font-medium">Confidence:</span> The likelihood that a second feature is present given the first feature is already observed.
      <br />
      <span class="italic">Example:</span> 80% of customers who were contacted previously also subscribed to the term deposit.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="text-blue-400 font-medium">Lift:</span> Measures how much more likely the second feature is to occur compared to when they are independent.
      <br />
      <span class="italic">Example:</span> A lift of 2.5 for "previous contact ‚Üí subscription" means that customers who were previously contacted are 2.5 times more likely to subscribe than a random customer.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-white text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Association Rules in This Project</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify mb-6 mt-2">
    ARM generates rules that describe strong relationships between features. A typical rule looks like this:

    <span class="bg-gray-800 text-blue-400 font-mono text-sm px-2 py-1 rounded inline-block mt-5">{Long Call Duration, Previous Contact} ‚Üí {Subscribed}</span>
    <br />

    This suggests that customers who had a long conversation and were contacted previously are more likely to subscribe to the term deposit.

    <li>
      <span class="text-blue-400 font-medium">"loan_no" is strongly connected:</span>  
      "loan_no" is associated with multiple attributes, including housing_no, job_management, and default_no.  
      This suggests that people who do not have a loan are also more likely to not have housing loans and may have specific job roles (like management).
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="text-blue-400 font-medium">"job_management" is central to multiple associations:</span>  
      It connects with default_no, poutcome_Unknown, and housing_no.  
      This suggests that individuals in management roles are likely to have specific financial behaviors.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="text-blue-400 font-medium">"y_no" (no subscription to the term deposit) is linked to multiple features:</span>  
      The outcome y_no (indicating no subscription to the marketing campaign) is associated with contact_cellular, education_tertiary, and default_no.  
      This implies that people with tertiary education, no default history, and those contacted via cellular may have a pattern of declining the term deposit offer.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="text-blue-400 font-medium">"poutcome_Unknown" is frequently associated:</span>

      The rule <span class="text-blue-400 font-medium">poutcome_Unknown, default_no, job_management, contact_cellular ‚Üí education_tertiary, housing_no, y_no</span> has the highest lift, revealing a strong and non-obvious relationship between job type, contact method, and campaign response.
